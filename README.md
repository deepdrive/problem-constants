# Deepdrive Botleague problem constants

Small shared package with constants shared between problem-endpoint, 
problem-coordinator, and 
problem-worker repos for Deepdrive's Botleague integration.

This is not meant for a PyPi package as different problem implementations
will want to use the same package name from a different github repo.
